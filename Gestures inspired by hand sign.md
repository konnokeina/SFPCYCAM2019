# **🚶‍♀️Gestures inspired by hand sign 🙌**
We'll think about how gesture change / grow in human communication through the technique of contemporary dance and hand sign method in this workshop.In this workshop, we will experience how physical words change and grow in communication from the relationship between gestures and words. Make movements by referring to the techniques of contemporary dance with the motif of sign language and body expression that digital archives have been difficult until now. In particular, we separate the symbolic meaning, the qualitative meaning, and the temporal meaning from the movement and "what is shared".
